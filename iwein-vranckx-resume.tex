	%Robust statistics to provide statistical methods which are not unduly affected
	%by outliers: multivariate observations that deviate from normal samples. 
	Classical statistical methods (e.g. SVM's, PCA, QDA, CNN's, ...) often have poor performance on datasets with outliers. Although it is fairly
	easy to show the dramatic effects caused by just
	one outlier, the use of robust statistics in industrial machine
	learning tasks is only gradually being recognized in the last years.  TOMRA Sorting develops industrial food inspection machines which process several
	gigabytes of high dimensional measurements in milliseconds, thereby pushing against the boundaries of the available computational power. 
	%Furthermore, the amount of	data is expected to grow over the coming years.
	My research activities proved that the cross-fertilization of industrial machine classifiers and robust statistical methods was beneficial. However, the extreme high computational
	load continuously forces research into massive parallelization technologies and – more importantly - the research and development of new, robust and sparse machine learning 
	methods which can process large datasets under real-time constraints.\\	
	To this end I initialised an intra disciplinary project between KULeuven, TOMRA and VLAIO which was directed towards strategic classification research with a clear defined economic finality. 	
	I was based at the MeBioS (Mechatronics, Biostatistics and Sensors) division, under the supervision of B. De Ketelaere, M. Hubert and P. J. Rousseeuw. \vspace{0.2em} \\

 GP-GPU's are powerful tools that are well-suited to unravelling complex, real-world problems, and form the foundation of today's deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow \& GPU accelerated optimization of SVM's. 
Due to the time criticality of our industrial classification tasks in day-to-day operations, combined with the vast amount of spectroscopic data, research into new, high performance (non-linear) modelling was essential. 
My research therefore focused specifically on the computational improvement of (ensembles of) LS-SVM's based on GPGPU's, which where then applied to spectroscopic datasets of various food related products. We effectively demonstrated the improved machine efficiency and computation times under real sorting conditions. \\

		\textit {Smart Sort} is TOMRA's commercial name for an algorithm that I developed in two years. It enables machines to auto-configure itself: after providing training data the framework automatically ensures the most efficient machine settings for a given specificity-sensitivity trade-off setting. Although multi-class classification is entirely  supported through ensemble learning, feedback from customers surprisingly learned us that it is mostly used as (an ensemble of) one class classifier(s). The algorithm is trained on good product(s) only, in turn demanding that the machine rejects all unknown, foreign materials such as glass, plastics and stones. It is currently still sold as a machine option, and it became the de-facto classifier standard for tobacco sorting as it reduces machine change-over time dramatically. I implemented the first prototypes entirely in Java using test-driven development, and guided the software team towards it commercial/persistent implementation afterwards.
